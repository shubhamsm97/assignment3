    <h2>Position(relative)</h2>
    <p>
        Render the element in spacific loction, the box can be placed everywhere in the body it can also be possible one box above  anathor box by using position.
        By default position is static.the offset is not usable like top/bottom/left/right/z-index then we require relative position to short out this problem. Relative position moved top/bottom with respact to it's own defalt position. Moving action will heppen without disturbing sibiling.

    <h2>position(absolute)</h2>
    <p>Absolute position always work with respact to its first positioned parent, comes in different layer.</p>
